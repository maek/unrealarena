# Unreal Arena

Unreal Arena is a fast-paced first-person shooter that aims to merge the
universes of Unreal Tournament and Quake III Arena. The idea behind it is very
simple: the player can choose from either side, determining in this way which
weapons/items/movements are available, and fight against other players of the
opposite faction with their own traits.

The game is a community developed open-source project powered by the
[Daemon](http://unvanquished.net) engine and has all content recreated from
scratch inspired by the original works.
